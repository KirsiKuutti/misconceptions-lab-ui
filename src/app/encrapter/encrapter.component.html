          This misconception is the belief that data is secure as long as encryption is being used. However, it fails to consider the limitations of encryption. For instance, data may be encrypted in transit but not while “at rest” (on storage media). It might not be clear to individuals how encryption schemes can be circumvented - for example, assuming that https is always secure, or that traffic is always secure when connected to a VPN. People who hold this misconception may also believe that cryptography does things it simply doesn’t, like guarantee data integrity or authenticity. They might also fail to recognize that while encryption may hide the content of messages, in many cases it does not hide metadata about the communication or other externally-visible properties, such as the length of the message, the time between messages, and so on.
