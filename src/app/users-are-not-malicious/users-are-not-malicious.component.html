        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <div>
          People who hold this misconception trust that users or other “upstream” data sources will only provide harmless input.  Users - either purposely or just through chance - may provide input that breaks the expected flow of the program. However, instead of trusting input, if input is treated as malicious “until proven innocent” by validating and sanitizing it before use, dangerous input cannot cause bad outcomes. Additionally, because of this process, normal users with unusual input are likely to get a better experience, as the program will always perform as expected.         </div>
