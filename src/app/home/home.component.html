          People often view security as a software problem with software solutions. Physical security issues cannot be
          entirely solved by software -- they commonly require physical solutions (e.g., armed guards, locks, and
          tamper-resistant hardware). People who hold this misconception view physical security as less important than
          its software counterparts. As a result of this belief, they also believe that physical security breaches are
          less severe than software-based ones, but this is also untrue. Many software-based security solutions depend
          at least partially on physical security and can in many cases be bypassed with physical access. For example,
          password protections can often be circumvented by taking the hard drive out of computer and mounting it under
          a different OS, communication media can be compromised by installing a keylogger or network sniffer, and keys
          and passwords can be acquired from individuals through threats or physical force.
